# Pomodoro System

This is a project from the online bootcam 'Odin Project' :

Here, I had to create a 'time management system' (called 'The Pomodoro Technique') application.
The Pomodoro Technique makes you work for a period of time, then take a short break, then work for a period of time then take a short break, and so on.

The goal was to have a first experience of pair programming.
So, I did this project with my life partner, who is a senior full stack developer.

I could learn a lot through pair programming, and go further than what I would have done alone.

The design is quite ugly, but I had fun doing it.
